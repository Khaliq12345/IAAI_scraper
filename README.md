IAAI.com is an auction site for used cars built with Python Playwright. 
This project utilizes web scraping techniques to gather information about used cars on the website and store it in a convenient format for analysis.

The scraper navigates through the website and follows links to other pages to scrape multiple car listings. 
The scraped data includes information such as car make, model, year, and auction details.

The data can be saved in a CSV file or any other preferred format for easy access and analysis. 
This scraper can be useful for anyone looking to collect and analyze data from the IAAI.com website.

Feel free to use the code as a reference for your own web scraping projects and make any changes as needed.
